Relationship between Height and weight using Linear Regression.


# Conclusion

1. Height and Weight are loosely positvely correlated

2. There may be more varability of heights in the middle weights, but that could also just have to do with the fact that there are more data points in the middle weights

3. There are many other factors that affect weight other than height.
